    "text": "Course Overview\n\nProbability vs Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we study probability, we have some data generating process (perhaps we are sampling from a known distribution, or we are sampling at random from a box with \\(N\\) items etc), and we want to know something about the random sample that we generate, and its properties.\nNow, when we study inference, we are given the sample, and we want to know more about the process that generated the data. That is, we want to infer something about the population, given the data that we observe.\n\n\nEstimation\n\nSimple Random Sampling\n\nWe might make no distributional assumptions about the population, and then try to estimate the population mean and variance and other parameters. This is the material we will study in Chapter 7, estimates from survey sampling. In this chapter we treat the estimate as a random variable that has a sampling distribution. This just means that each time we take a sample (of some fixed size) we get a different observed value of our random variable. All such possible values give us a distribution of the random variable (for example, the sample mean) which is called its sampling distribution.\nWhile investigating these estimates, we will talk about the concepts of bias, standard error, and mean squared error, confidence intervals, and how we apply the central limit theorem. Here are two visualizations of the CLT, with the top row showing the sampling distribution of the sample mean of random samples of \\(Unif(0,1)\\) random variables for various \\(n\\). The bottom row does the same for a \\(Gamma(2,1)\\) distribution. You can see how even though we begin with distributions that are very far from a normal distribution, for larger \\(n\\), the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResampling methods: We will use the bootstrap to estimate confidence bounds for our parameters. When possible, we will compare these confidence intervals to the ones obtained by classical methods.\n\n\n\nEstimating distributional parameters\n\nOn the other hand, depending on what we know about the population, we might build models with distributional assumptions: for example, the number of goals in the soccer World Cup could be modeled using the Poisson distribution.\nOr perhaps we might consider classification problems, maybe whether an item is defective or not. In this case we might use the Bernoulli distribution.\nIf we assume some distribution, then we will want to estimate the parameters of that distribution. Chapter 8 is about parameter estimation, in which we have observed data, and try to fit probability laws to this data. We will learn about maximum likelihood estimation, and the method of moments, see which method is preferred and why. We will develop the ideas of Bayesian inference, and define an efficient estimator, and prove the famous Cramér-Rao inequality.\nWe will also derive properties of the distribution of our Maximum Likelihood Estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{mle}}\\), \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{mle}} = \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{\\theta \\in \\Theta} \\hat{L}_n(\\theta;\\mathbf{y})\n\\]\nwhere \\[\n\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{mle}}-\\theta_0) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{N}(0, \\mathcal{I}^{-1})\n\\]\n\nand \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) is the Fisher information. All this is in Chapter 8 of our text, which is perhaps the most mathematical of the material we will cover.\n\n\n\nHypothesis Testing\n\nThis is the topic of Chapter 9. Hypothesis tests is a method of statistical inference in which we decide if the observed data supports a particular hypothesis. We will learn about the Neyman-Pearson paradigm. We also look at various tests, including goodness of fit, which we will also look at in Chapter 11. We will define the power of a test, and also look at the duality of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.\nWe will further develop the ideas of hypothesis testing in Chapter 11, when we look at classical and nonparametric methods for two-sample tests, and in Chapters 12 and 13 we will see how ANOVA is used to compare multiple groups. Chapters 9 and 13 deal with categorical data, so we will look at these together.\nWe will also look at more computationally intensive resampling methods such as permutation tests.\n\n\n\nLinear Models\n\nChapter 14 is about linear least squares. We will go over the simple regression model in some detail, but only briefly cover the more general treatment.\n\n\n\nThe Bayesian Paradigm\n\nMost of the time, we will use a classical, frequentist approach to our analysis, in which parameters are fixed quantities, and probability statements are made only about sampled data and estimates.\nIn Bayesian statistics, the parameters are random, and we assume a distribution that reflects our beliefs about them. Then we update our beliefs given the observed data.\nWe compute posterior distributions (post-data) using Bayes’ Rule.\n\n\n\n\nImage from Nieves “An Actual Introduction to Bayesian Statistics (2021)”, cantorsparadise.com",

Homework will be posted to Gradescope usually by Friday, and will generally be due the following Friday at 11:59 pm. Homework will be a combination of analytical and computational exercises done “by hand” and data analysis using R. If you turn in your homework late, you will get half credit for homework that is up to 24 hours late (if you have not requested an extension), and no credit after that.\n\n\nQuizzes\nThere will be four 50-minute quizzes to test your understanding of homework and lecture. You will take the quizzes in the CBTF (Computer-Based Testing Facility) in 200 Sutardja Dai Hall. The dates of the quizzes are: Feb 12/13, Feb 26/27, Apr 9/10, and Apr 30/May 1. You will have to schedule your quiz during the given dates at the CBTF. We do not schedule your quiz for you. Note that DSP students will also take it in the CBTF and will get their extended time. We will drop your lowest quiz score, and you may retake ** at most one** quiz, also in the CBTF, during the week following the original quiz dates. Dates for each retake will be announced later, and you will have to fill out a form to be registered for the retake.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be one midterm exam and the final exam. The midterm exam will be a two hour exam which will be held in the evening from 8 - 10 pm  during the week before spring break. I will announce the exact details as soon as I can. The final exam time and day are Tuesday, May 12, 11:30 am - 2:30 pm (group 6). If you do not take the final exam, you will not pass the class.\n\n\nExtra Credit Opportunities\nExtra credit is assigned at the end of the semester after the grade bins have been determined. Ways to get extra credit (it will be added to your overall course percentage):\n\nDiagnostic test: 0.25% for submission with some clear attempt at solving the questions.\nEdStem: The top 5 student answerers will get up to 0.5% extra credit.\n\n\n\nAttendance Quizzes\nAs stated above, there will be 8-10 attendance quizzes handed out in lecture throughout the semester. These will be graded on completion, and you will need to complete five of them to get all the attendance points.\n\n\nOverall Score\nYour letter grade for the course will be based a weighted average of your assessments, as follows:\n\nHomework (each assignment weighted equally, drop two lowest): 15%\nQuizzes: 15% (equally weighted, drop lowest)\nMidterm: 25% (can be clobbered by the final)\nFinal exam: 40% or 65% (if higher than the midterm)\nAttendance quizzes: 5%\n\nRough grade bins: Students earning a course average of at least 88% are guaranteed to receive an A- or better, students earning a course average of at least 75% are guaranteed a B- or better, and students earning at least 60% on their course average are guaranteed at least a C-.

    "text": "Important sites to bookmark\n\nR Datahub\nAll coding in this class will be done in R. You may download the desktop version of RStudio if you wish, but it might be easier to use the datahub. It is up to you. Just make sure you have the latest version of R and RStudio, if you would like to download it to your laptop.\n\n\nBcourses\nImportant coursewide announcements will be sent out on bcourses.\n\n\nEd Discussion\nI have created a Ed discussion page for this course, which you can access through the link in bCourses (so you will be logged in). This is an online forum to ask questions to fellow students and answer other students’ questions. The GSIs and I will have access to the forum and may endorse or occasionally answer questions but this is primarily a forum for students to help each other – if you need an instructor or GSI’s assistance please attend office hours. Extra credit of up to 0.5% on the final course score will be awarded to the five students who have responded to the most questions on Ed by the end of the semester (with reasonable attempts at answering the questions).\n\n\nCBTF\nThis semester, you will be taking your quizzes in the Computer-Based Testing Facility in Sutardja Dai Hall. In order to take the test, you will have to log into the course site using your Calnet ID. I will post a practice quiz so that you can get the hang of how to do the scheduling etc. Meanwhile, take a look at the page “CBTF Getting Started for Students”.\n\n\nGradescope\nHomework assignments, take-home exams, and regrade requests (see Policies section below) will be submitted through Gradescope, which you can also access through the link in bCourses (you should not add yourself to Gradescope, as the roster has already been uploaded). You can view your grades here, as I will not be creating assignments on bCourses.\n\n\nFlextensions\nYou can request extensions of up to two days for up to two homework assignments, using this page, once assignments have been posted on Gradescope. You must make the request before the due date. If you have DSP accommodations, please send us a private message on Ed.",

    "section": "Academic Honesty Policy",
    "text": "Academic Honesty Policy\nThe student community at UC Berkeley has adopted the following Honor Code: “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.”.\nMy expectation is that you will adhere to this code. Beyond the importance of respecting your fellow students, acting with integrity in completing course assignments helps ensure that they achieve their purpose, which is to help you learn and develop valuable statistical understanding and skills. Homework must be done independently. If you get stuck or want to explore alternative approaches, feel free to discuss issues with students or course staff at the homework parties or on Ed. You may ask an AI tool for help understanding a concept, or figuring out a coding error (but note that the answers are not always correct), but putting assignment questions into an AI tool and then copying and pasting/paraphrasing the answers will be considered plagiarism. It is also completely negates the purpose of the homework, which is to cement and internalize concepts from the course. It will not serve you for the exam either, when you have to tackle the problems on your own. I leave it to you to decide how much you would like to use genAI tools, but please use them with caution.",
