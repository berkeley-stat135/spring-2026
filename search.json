It will look something like calendarID@group.calendar.google.com.\nFor example, in the embed URL https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=calendarID@group.calendar.google.com, calendarID@group.calendar.google.com is the part you need.\n\nCreate a Single Embed Link:\n\nUse the base URL for embedding multiple calendars: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?\nAppend each calendar ID to the base URL using the format &src=calendarID@group.calendar.google.com for each calendar you want to include.\nOptionally, you can customize the appearance by adding parameters (e.g., &color=%23F6BF26 for the color, &ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles for the time zone).\n\nFor example, if you have two calendars with IDs calendar1ID@group.calendar.google.com and calendar2ID@group.calendar.google.com, your combined embed link would look like this:\n\nhttps://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=calendar1ID@group.calendar.google.com&src=calendar2ID@group.calendar.google.com\n\nSubstitute this URL into the src attribute of the calendar’s iframe at the top of this page.",

Homework will be posted to Gradescope usually by Friday, and will generally be due the following Friday at 11:59 pm. Homework will be a combination of analytical and computational exercises done “by hand” and data analysis using R. If you turn in your homework late, you will get half credit for homework that is up to 24 hours late (if you have not requested an extension), and no credit after that.\n\n\nQuizzes\nThere will be four 50-minute quizzes to test your understanding of homework and lecture. You will take the quizzes in the CBTF (Computer-Based Testing Facility) in 200 Sutardja Dai Hall. The dates of the quizzes are: Feb 12/13, Feb 26/27, Apr 9/10, and Apr 30/May 1. You will have to schedule your quiz during the given dates at the CBTF. We do not schedule your quiz for you. Note that DSP students will also take it in the CBTF and will get their extended time. We will drop your lowest quiz score, and you may retake one quiz, also in the CBTF, during the week following the original quiz dates. Dates for each retake will be announced later. Note that if you retake more than 1 quiz, we will count only the first time you retake a quiz, and you will be penalized for trying to circumvent course policy.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be one midterm exam and the final exam. The midterm exam will be a two hour exam which will be held in the evening from 8 - 10 pm  during the week before spring break. I will announce the exact details as soon as I can. The final exam time and day are Tuesday, May 12, 11:30 am - 2:30 pm (group 6). If you do not take the final exam, you will not pass the class.\n\n\nExtra Credit Opportunities\nExtra credit is assigned at the end of the semester after the grade bins have been determined. Ways to get extra credit (it will be added to your overall course percentage):\n\nDiagnostic test: 0.25% for submission with some clear attempt at solving the questions.\nEdStem: The top 5 student answerers will get up to 0.5% extra credit.\n\n\n\nAttendance Quizzes\nAs stated above, there will be 8-10 attendance quizzes handed out in lecture throughout the semester. These will be graded on completion, and you will need to complete five of them to get all the attendance points.\n\n\nOverall Score\nYour letter grade for the course will be based a weighted average of your assessments, as follows:\n\nHomework (each assignment weighted equally, drop two lowest): 15%\nQuizzes: 15% (equally weighted, drop lowest)\nMidterm: 25% (can be clobbered by the final)\nFinal exam: 40% or 65% (if higher than the midterm)\nAttendance quizzes: 5%\n\nRough grade bins: Students earning a course average of at least 88% are guaranteed to receive an A- or better, students earning a course average of at least 75% are guaranteed a B- or better, and students earning at least 60% on their course average are guaranteed at least a C-. These bins might move down, depending on how the class does.",

You may download the desktop version of RStudio if you wish, but it might be easier to use the datahub. It is up to you. Just make sure you have the latest version of R and RStudio, if you would like to download it to your laptop.\n\n\nBcourses\nImportant coursewide announcements will be sent out on bcourses.\n\n\nEd Discussion\nI have created a Ed discussion page for this course, which you can access through the link in bCourses (so you will be logged in). This is an online forum to ask questions to fellow students and answer other students’ questions. The GSIs and I will have access to the forum and may endorse or occasionally answer questions but this is primarily a forum for students to help each other – if you need an instructor or GSI’s assistance please attend office hours. Extra credit of up to 0.5% on the final course score will be awarded to the five students who have responded to the most questions on Ed by the end of the semester (with reasonable attempts at answering the questions).\n\n\nCBTF\nThis semester, you will be taking your quizzes in the Computer-Based Testing Facility in Sutardja Dai Hall. In order to take the test, you will have to log into the course site using your Calnet ID. I will post a practice quiz so that you can get the hang of how to do the scheduling etc. Meanwhile, take a look at the page “CBTF Getting Started for Students”.\n\n\nGradescope\nHomework assignments, take-home exams, and regrade requests (see Policies section below) will be submitted through Gradescope, which you can also access through the link in bCourses (you should not add yourself to Gradescope, as the roster has already been uploaded). You can view your grades here, as I will not be creating assignments on bCourses.\n\n\nFlextensions\nYou can request extensions of up to two days for up to two homework assignments, using this page, once assignments have been posted on Gradescope. You must make the request before the due date. If you have DSP accommodations, please send us a private message on Ed.",

Beyond the importance of respecting your fellow students, acting with integrity in completing course assignments helps ensure that they achieve their purpose, which is to help you learn and develop valuable statistical understanding and skills. Homework must be done independently. If you get stuck or want to explore alternative approaches, feel free to discuss issues with students or course staff at the homework parties or on Ed. You may ask an AI tool for help understanding a concept, or figuring out a coding error (but note that the answers are not always correct), but putting assignment questions into an AI tool and then copying and pasting/paraphrasing the answers will be considered plagiarism. It is also completely negates the purpose of the homework, which is to cement and internalize concepts from the course. It will not serve you for the exam either, when you have to tackle the problems on your own. I leave it to you to decide how much you would like to use genAI tools, but please use them with caution.",

I am happy to use your preferred name and/or personal pronoun. If you feel uncomfortable as a result of anything that is said in class, or if you feel that your performance in the course is being impacted by experiences outside of class, please do not hesitate to reach out to me about your concerns. If you are uncomfortable being called on during class, just let me know.\nIn addition, if you need accommodations for any physical, psychological, or learning disability, please speak to me after class or during office hours. Please note that you must make arrangements in a timely manner through DSP so that I can make the appropriate accommodations.",
